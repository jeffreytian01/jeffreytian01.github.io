                    <h5>    
                        My name is Jeffrey Tian, and I am currently pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Michigan.
                         I was born and raised in Cupertino, California, but my family recently moved to Palo Alto, California. 
                         As a software engineer, my goal is to create technology that simplifies everyday life by 
                         making it more convenient and efficient, whether it be through communication, health care, entertainment, or travel. 
                         By the end of my career, I hope to visibly see my impact on the world.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        But that's still a long way down the road. My career is just starting! During the summer of 2021, I gained my first work experience 
                        as a SDE intern at Amazon. I was given the opporunity to plan out and own a 10-week intern project by addressing the problems at hand 
                        and laying out steps to the solution, all while setting clear deadlines for myself. As a result of the internship, not only did I grow my 
                        communication and teamwork skills, but I also learned how to be a professional in the workplace, whether it be about the quality of my code, 
                        the ownership of my work, or the dedication to deliver results.
                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        I am excited for the next step of my journey, and I hope to keep learning and growing along the way.
